          <p>
            After graduating from the University of Guelph, I discovered Udemy
            and enrolled in courses for graphic design and web-development. As I
            became more proficient with visual editing software like Adobe
            Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, I began creating logos, icon sets,
            business cards, and even animations, for many clients and even some
            local businesses.
            <br />
            <br />
            Currently, my primary goal is to assit experienced software
            developers on larger projects to gain further experience in the
            industry. Iâ€™ve completed courses on Javascript and Node.js, and I'm
            familiar with CSS and the React library. Please get in touch with me
            if you think I can help!
